# Promptre

**Promptre** is a JSX-based library used to make **prompt**s **re**active. This project is heavily inspired by [Priompt](https://github.com/anysphere/priompt). However, Promptre is a toy library with minimal features and slightly different syntax suited to my own needs.

An example server running Promptre can be found in `/examples/api/`.
